# 1.0 Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this project is to analyse the ride share fares in the listed Urban, Suburban and Rural cities and come up with business proposals to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.


# 2.0 Results
Below is the results of the ride share analysis.

# 2.1 Analysis from Pyber Summary DF
2.1.1 When looking at the Pyber Summary DF, the average fare in rural is much higher than the urban and suburban cities. This could be due to the 2 below factors.
 - Number of drivers is very less.
 - Number of customers is also very less in rural cities.
2.1.2 Summary of Ride Shares data
  City Type     Total Drivers     Total Fares     Avg Fare / Ride     Avg Fare / Driver
  Rural         78                $4,327.93	      $34.62              $55.49
  Suburban      490               $19,356.33	    $30.97	            $39.50
  Urban         1625              $39,854.38	    $24.53              $16.57
  
# 2.2. Analysis from Pyber_fare)summary.png
2.2.1. In rural cities, the total fare across months remains almost similar except for some spikes in few weeks.
2.2.2. In Urban cities, the total fare increases between March to May which shows these are much busy months.
2.2.3. In Suburban cities, the total fare is alomst consistent across the months except for April and first half of May.


# 2.3 Summary / Business Proposal
1. There is a huge scope of market capture in Rural cities. It is time for us to focus there by bringing in more drivers and reducing the fare. This will help the population to turn towards ride sharing that=n any other means of public transportation. 
2. The performance in Urban cities are much better from March to May. These months are considered to be peak months. The fare shall be increased by some percentage for peak hour rides during these months to start with. Also increase the incentive to the drivers, which will attreact more drivers during these peak months and more people would opt for ride sharing due to convenience due to more frequency of drivers.
3. In Suburban cities, we may need to increase drivers so that ride sharing for people is available within few minutes. AT this time the fare should remain the same and see how the performance has impacted by adding more drivers in the next few months.
